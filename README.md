# pwa-push-notifications-demo
A Next.js PWA notification permission flow for iOS/Android with native platform detection.

This project provides a production-ready "Notification Step" screen designed to navigate the unique technical constraints of mobile push notifications. It specifically addresses the iOS 16.4+ requirement for "Add to Home Screen" installation before native permissions can be granted.
